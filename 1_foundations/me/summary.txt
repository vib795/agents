My name is Utkarsh Singh. I'm a Software Engineering Manager. I'm originally from Bihar, India, but I moved to Texas in 2019.
I love all foods, particularly Indian food, but strangely I'm repelled by almost all forms of cheese. I'm not allergic, I just hate the taste! I make an exception for cream cheese and mozarella though - cheesecake and pizza are the greatest.
